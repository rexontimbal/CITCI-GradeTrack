# CITCI GradeTrack

Grading Management System with Academic Performance Forecasting — College Department, Candelaria
Institute of Technology of Cabadbaran, Inc. (CITCI).

Built in phases; see `CLAUDE.md` (project root, one level up) for the full build specification.
**Phase 1** covered authentication, role-based access control, and the navigation shell.
**Phase 2 / 2.1** (this state of the repo) add the academic structure: academic years/semesters,
programs, majors, sections, subjects, classes (which can serve several sections at once), student
profiles, and class lists. Grading, approvals, and forecasting are still role-gated "Coming soon"
placeholders.

**CITCI GradeTrack does not handle student enrollment** — that's the Registrar's own process. It
only stores each class's official student list ("class list" — see `academics.ClassRosterEntry`),
built by hand or imported from a Registrar .xlsx/.csv export, so instructors have someone to grade.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 14+ running locally (or reachable over the network)
- Windows: no extra system packages needed — `django-tailwind-cli` downloads its own Tailwind CLI
  binary on first use, and HTMX/Alpine.js are already vendored under `static/vendor/`.

## Setup (Windows)

```powershell
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Create the PostgreSQL database and a role for the app (run once, via psql or pgAdmin)
#    adjust the password to match what you put in .env below
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE ROLE citci_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'citci_pass';"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE citci_gradetrack OWNER citci_user;"

# 4. Copy the environment template and fill in real values
copy .env.example .env
#    - SECRET_KEY: generate one, e.g.
#      python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key as g; print(g())"
#    - DATABASE_URL: postgres://citci_user:citci_pass@127.0.0.1:5432/citci_gradetrack

# 5. Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# 6. Seed demo accounts (one per role) and real CITCI A.Y. 2026-2027 academic data
python manage.py seed_demo_users
python manage.py seed_citci_academics

# 7. Build Tailwind CSS (downloads the Tailwind CLI binary the first time)
python manage.py tailwind build
#    while developing, use the watcher instead, in its own terminal:
#    python manage.py tailwind watch

# 8. Run the dev server
python manage.py runserver
```

## Demo accounts

All demo accounts share the password `Demo@1234` and must change it (then accept the Data Privacy
notice) on first login — that's expected, not a bug.

| Username | Role |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Admin (also a Django superuser — `/admin/` works) |
| `program_head` | Program Head |
| `instructor` | Instructor |
| `student` | Student |

Re-running `python manage.py seed_demo_users` resets all four accounts (password, forced-password-
change flag, and privacy consent) back to a fresh first-login state.

`python manage.py seed_citci_academics` (safe to re-run) loads real CITCI offerings from
`docs/source/citci_offerings_2026_2027.json` — A.Y. 2026–2027 with an active 1st Sem, programs
BSED (majors English & Social Studies) and TCP, sections BSED-ENG/SS 1–4 + TCP, ~84 subjects, ~96
classes (several shared across sections/majors — e.g. a Gen Ed subject taught once for two
majors), one INSTRUCTOR account per real instructor (username from surname, e.g. `garibay`,
password `Demo@1234`, no forced password change — the demo `instructor` login is repurposed to
be "Mr. Honrejas" so it shows real classes), and ~10 demo students per section (password
`Demo@1234`, no forced password change) all on their sections' class lists. The existing `student`
account is linked to BSED-ENG 1 and `program_head` heads both BSED and TCP.

That JSON is generated from the Registrar's .docx via
`python manage.py import_offerings_docx docs/source/all_subject_per_major.docx` (needs
`requirements-dev.txt`: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`) — re-run it only if CITCI sends an
updated offerings sheet. It also writes `docs/source/DATA_ISSUES.md`, listing instructor-name
pairs that look like they might be the same person misspelled/mistitled (e.g. "Mr. Garibay" vs
"Ms. Garibay") — these are **never auto-merged**, confirm with CITCI first.

## Running tests

```powershell
python manage.py test
```

## Where things live

- **Brand colors / theme:** `.django_tailwind_cli/source.css` (Tailwind `@theme` tokens, generated
  from the CITCI logo's measured navy/gold — see that file's header comment for the source values
  and the WCAG contrast notes).
- **Sidebar menu per role:** `accounts/menu.py`.
- **Role-based access control:** `accounts/decorators.py` (`role_required`) and
  `accounts/mixins.py` (`RoleRequiredMixin`).
- **Forced password-change / privacy-consent gate:** `accounts/middleware.py`.
- **Generic list/create/update/delete scaffolding** (shared by every admin academic-setup page —
  Academic Years, Semesters, Programs, Sections, Subjects, Classes): `core/crud.py`. Pages built on
  it (`academics/views.py`) swap a fragment into the shared modal (markup lives in `base.html`,
  generic fragments in `templates/partials/_entity_form_modal.html` and
  `_confirm_delete_modal.html`) via HTMX, and refresh their table via an `HX-Trigger` response
  header.
- **HTMX + Django CSRF:** `static/js/htmx-csrf.js` attaches the CSRF cookie to every HTMX request
  header — required for any bare `hx-post`/`hx-delete` button that isn't inside a `<form>`.
- **Class list import** (.xlsx/.csv, admin for any class, instructor for their own):
  `academics/roster_import.py` (parse + preview + commit) and the views/templates prefixed
  `class_list_import_*`. Matches students by `id_number`; creates a new STUDENT account if none exists.
- **Registrar .docx → seed data pipeline:** `academics/management/commands/import_offerings_docx.py`
  parses `docs/source/all_subject_per_major.docx` into `docs/source/citci_offerings_2026_2027.json`
  (+ `docs/source/DATA_ISSUES.md`); `seed_citci_academics` loads that JSON into the database.
- **Templates:** `templates/` (shared layout + partials in `templates/partials/`, app templates
  under `templates/<app>/`).
- **Static files:** `static/` — `static/vendor/` holds the locally-vendored HTMX and Alpine.js
  builds (no CDN), `static/img/citci-logo.png` is the official logo, `static/css/tailwind.css` is
  the compiled stylesheet (build artifact — not committed, run `tailwind build`/`tailwind watch`
  to produce it).

## Tech stack

Django 5.2, PostgreSQL (via psycopg 3), Django Templates + HTMX + Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS via the
standalone CLI (`django-tailwind-cli`, no Node.js required), Pillow, openpyxl (class list
import/template). `requirements-dev.txt` adds python-docx, needed only to regenerate the seed data
JSON from a Registrar .docx. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full rationale and later-phase plans (grading
engine, ML forecasting service, etc.).
